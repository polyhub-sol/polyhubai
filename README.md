## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/polyhub-sol/polyhubai.git
   cd polyhubai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```
   
   > **Note**: `gpt-4o-mini` is recommended for cost efficiency, but you can use `gpt-4o` for more accurate forecasts.

4. **Run the development server**

## 📖 Usage

### Exploring Markets

1. **Browse Markets**: Visit `/markets` to see live Polymarket questions sorted by volume
2. **Select a Market**: Click any market card to view detailed analysis
3. **Compare Probabilities**: See AI vs market probabilities side-by-side with animated bars
4. **Read AI Reasoning**: Review the AI's explanation and bullet points for its forecast
5. **View on Polymarket**: Click "Open on Polymarket" to see the original market

### Understanding the Analysis

- **AI Probabilities**: Structured forecasts generated by OpenAI that must sum to 1.0
- **Market Probabilities**: Current implied probabilities from Polymarket trading activity
- **Edge**: The difference (AI - Market) shows where the model sees opportunities
- **Reasoning**: Natural language explanation of the AI's forecast logic

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Market Fetching**: Server-side requests to Polymarket Gamma API fetch active markets
2. **Market Selection**: User clicks a market to view detailed analysis
3. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI receives market context and generates:
   - Probability distribution (must sum to 1.0)
   - Reasoning text
   - Bullet points
   - Optional sources
4. **Comparison Display**: UI shows side-by-side comparison with animated probability bars
5. **Edge Calculation**: System calculates `edge = AI_probability - Market_probability` for each outcome
